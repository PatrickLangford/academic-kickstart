# "I am a 1st year Trainee Educational Psychology student at the Institute of Education, UCL. I have worked as a Trainee Educational Psychologist (TEP) with Enfield and Waltham Forest Educational Psychology Services (EPS). My first year project is on one of the main models of service delivery: consultation. I am exploring what happens during an intial consultation between a teacher and an Educational Psychologist (EP) and then using this to develop a theoretical framework. This will form the basis for a long-term evaluation tool of consultation. My interests also include open science, philosophy of science, meta science, and statistics."
